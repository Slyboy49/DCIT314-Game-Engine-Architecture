Setting Up the Game Engine:

1. Open your terminal/command prompt.

2. Clone the GitHub repository by running this command:
   
   git clone https://github.com/Slyboy49/DCIT314-Game-Engine-Architecture.git
   

3. Change the directory to the project folder:
   
   cd DCIT314-Game-Engine-Architecture
   

4. Make sure you have the necessary libraries for input (keyboard, mouse, game controller) and audio installed. You might need to refer to your specific project's documentation to determine which libraries to install.

5. Build the game engine using the provided build script or commands. The exact command may vary based on your project's build setup. Use this as an example:
   
   make
   

6. Execute the game engine application:
   
   ./game-engine
   

7. Explore the game engine's capabilities, including the editor for creating games and scripting support.

Playing a Game:

1. Within the game engine, use the built-in editor to load an existing game project or create a new one.

2. Follow the in-game instructions to play the selected game.

Export Standalone Games:
1. If you wish to share the game with others, utilize the engine's export feature to create standalone game packages. The exact steps for exporting games will depend on the features and options provided by your specific game engine.

By following these steps and ensuring you have the required dependencies and libraries installed, you can be able to set up and run the Mini-Game Engine smoothly.
